/*
 Basic implementation of Huffman encoding. It encodes bytes that occur often
 with a smaller number of bits than bytes that occur less frequently.
 Based on Al Stevens' C Programming column from Dr.Dobb's Magazine, February
 1991 and October 1992.
 Note: This code is not optimized for speed but explanation.
